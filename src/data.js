      name: 'Actinic Keratosis (AKIEC)',
      description:
        'Actinic Keratosis is a precancerous condition characterized by rough, scaly patches on the skin caused by excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. These lesions can potentially develop into squamous cell carcinoma if left untreated.',
      earlySigns:
        'Look for rough, dry, or scaly patches on sun-exposed areas like the face, ears, neck, scalp, chest, backs of hands, forearms, or lips. These patches may be red, pink, brown, or skin-colored.',
      preventionTips:
        'Protect your skin from excessive sun exposure by wearing sunscreen, seeking shade, and wearing protective clothing. Regularly check your skin for any new or changing lesions.',

      id: 'bcc',
      name: 'Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)',
      description:
        'Basal Cell Carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer. It usually occurs on sun-exposed areas of the body, such as the face and neck. BCC grows slowly and rarely spreads to other parts of the body, but if left untreated, it can cause significant local damage.',
      earlySigns:
        'Watch for pearly or waxy bumps, flat, flesh-colored, or brown scar-like lesions, or bleeding sores that don’t heal. BCC often appears on the face, ears, or neck.',
      preventionTips:
        'Avoid prolonged sun exposure, use sunscreen with high SPF, and wear protective clothing. Regular skin checks can help detect BCC early.',

      name: 'Benign Keratosis-like Lesions (BKL)',
      description:
        'Benign Keratosis-like Lesions are non-cancerous growths that resemble keratoses, which include seborrheic keratoses and lichen planus-like keratoses. These lesions are typically harmless but can sometimes be confused with skin cancer.',
      earlySigns:
        'These lesions often appear as rough, scaly, or wart-like growths. They can vary in color from light tan to black and are commonly found on the chest, back, scalp, face, or neck.',
      preventionTips:
        'While these lesions are generally benign, it’s essential to monitor them for any changes. Protect your skin from excessive sun exposure to reduce the risk of skin damage.',

      name: 'Dermatofibroma (DF)',
      description:
        'Dermatofibroma is a common, benign skin growth that often appears on the lower legs. It is firm to the touch and may feel like a small, hard lump under the skin. Dermatofibromas are usually harmless and do not require treatment.',
      earlySigns:
        'Look for small, firm, raised bumps that are usually brownish or tan. They can be tender or itchy and may dimple inward when pinched.',
      preventionTips:
        'Since dermatofibromas are benign, no specific prevention is needed. However, protecting your skin from injuries and avoiding unnecessary skin trauma can be beneficial.',

      name: 'Melanoma (MEL)',
      description:
        'Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer, developing in the cells that produce melanin (the pigment that gives your skin its color). It can spread rapidly to other parts of the body if not detected early.',
      earlySigns:
        'Watch for new moles or changes in existing moles, such as asymmetry, irregular borders, multiple colors, or increasing size. Melanomas often appear as dark, irregular spots or sores that do not heal.',
      preventionTips:
        'Avoid tanning beds, use broad-spectrum sunscreen, wear protective clothing, and regularly examine your skin for any changes. Early detection is crucial for successful treatment.',

      name: 'Melanocytic Nevi (NV)',
      description:
        'Melanocytic Nevi, commonly known as moles, are usually benign growths of melanocytes, the cells that produce pigment. While most nevi are harmless, some can develop into melanoma, so monitoring for changes is essential.',
      earlySigns:
        'Moles are generally uniform in color and shape, with defined edges. Be alert to changes in size, shape, or color, as well as itching, bleeding, or other unusual symptoms.',
      preventionTips:
        'Regular skin checks and avoiding excessive sun exposure are key to preventing complications. Report any changes in moles to a dermatologist promptly.',
